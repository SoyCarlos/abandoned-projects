# abandoned-projects
This is my wasteland for projects I started (or maybe just made a repo for), but abandoned whether for lack of interest or time. Anyone can feel free to come in and swoop one if they feel so inspired. Maybe I'll be inspired one weekend and bring back a project from the grave.

# ABSA2019 
Started: May 2019  
Abandoned: September 2019  


ABSA is the Annual Budgeting and Spaces Application conducted yearly, as the name implies, at UC Berkeley. This decided what spaces clubs got (storage rooms, actual rooms, etc) and the budget they received. The budget depended on the tenure of the club, the type of club, and other factors. This was managed by UC Berkeley's student government, ASUC. As you can 
imagine, when you are managing and allocating a few million dollars in student fees, there will always be controversy on how it is allocated. 


This project was going to analyze the historic trends in allocating budgets, and look into the possibility of pitching a more equitable approach to allocating money.

# bot-testing
Started: May 2021  
Abandoned: July 2021  


This was going to be a discord bot for the dat0s community.

# Library-Analytics
Started: March 2019  
Abandoned: September 2019  


This was going to analyze the historic trends in the amount of people in UC Berkeley libraries, and from that, develop a predictor and website that would inform students that on this Day at this time this library should be X% full. This was going to take into account factors like weather, weekday vs weekend, midterm season, finals season, holidays, etc.


Library-wise, my pipe dream was to develop a recommender system for students using the library, but I never acquired the relevant data (because I did not try to).

# love_in_music
Started: February 2020  
Abandoned: February 2020  


I was analyzing my listening history (collected from Spotify and last.fm), combining data from Spotify's API (valence, etc), and pulling the lyrics to later analyze. The goal was to see how many of the songs were love-related (heartbreak, love ballad, etc) and if it changed around valentines day or any other time of the year.

# military_spending
Started: October 2019  
Abandoned: October 2019  


Straightforward, was going to compare military spending between most countries and see how it compares to other categories (health, education, etc).

# Roomies
Started: December 2019  
Abandoned: January 2020  


Was going to be a roommate management app developed in Flutter. This would allow you to split up chores, groceries (remind you to buy, what's expiring, etc), and bills (like SplitWise). Started and abandoned with Moises Ortega.

# sotu-nlp
Started: February 2020  
Abandoned: May 2021  


NLP Analysis on State of the Union speeches. Was going to try and then develop a classifier that would predict what party the president who delivered a speech belonged to.

# SummerInDC
Started: June 2019  
Abandoned: October 2019  


Includes all(?) my WMATA use data during my 2019 Summer in Washington DC. Was going to develop basic charts around my use of certain lines/stations and then develop a Plotly animation of my use throughout the summer.
